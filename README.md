# Kirby3 whatever

This is a test/demonstration plugin for kirby3.

It provides a panel field called 'whatever' that should simply spit out "whatever".

Essentially it is the "hello world" example from the kirby3 docs made available as a plugin and composer packagist installable.

Test case:

```yaml
fields:
  whatever:
    type: whatever
    message: Computer Says Whatever.
```
